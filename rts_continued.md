### Core Movement Mechanics

Movement defines everything. Players must feel the weight of exhaustion, the calculation of route selection, the tension between speed and safety. This requires:

**Stamina as currency**: Every action depletes a central resource pool. Running costs more than walking. Climbing exponentially more than running. Swimming more than climbing. Players must constantly calculate optimal energy expenditure.

**Terrain resistance**: Different surfaces multiply stamina costs. Mud slows movement by 40%. Water by 60%. Rocky terrain increases fall risk. These aren't arbitrary numbers—they're derived from actual caloric expenditure data in wilderness racing.

**Team tethering**: Partners cannot separate beyond 50 meters. If one falls, both must stop. If one exhausts stamina, the other must share their reserve or abandon them. This simple constraint creates profound social dynamics.

### Hunger Psychology Implementation

Hunger drives authentic desperation. The system tracks caloric deficit in real numbers:

**Base metabolic burn**: 2,000 calories/day at rest
**Movement multipliers**: Walking (2x), Running (6x), Climbing (8x)
**Environmental factors**: Cold adds 20%, wet conditions add 15%

As deficit increases, measurable effects compound:
- **Vision narrowing** at -2,000 calories
- **Decision accuracy degradation** at -4,000 calories  
- **Movement speed reduction** at -6,000 calories
- **Hallucination risk** at -8,000 calories

These aren't game balance decisions—they're physiological realities that create authentic psychological pressure.

### Social Dynamics Through Constraint

The two-player team structure forces cooperation through mechanical interdependence:

**Shared inventory weight**: Items can be distributed between players, but total weight affects both. One player carrying everything moves at 50% speed. Equal distribution maintains 80% for both.

**Complementary abilities**: Each player selects a background (Climber, Navigator, Forager, Medic) that provides specific advantages. Optimal teams combine complementary skills rather than duplicating strengths.

**Trust mechanics**: Certain actions require mutual consent—splitting up temporarily, consuming shared resources, choosing routes. Disagreement costs time. Time costs position. Position costs survival.

### Environmental Challenge Design

The MVP requires three distinct biomes that test different capabilities:

**Alpine**: Vertical movement, exposure management, navigation in low visibility
**Forest**: Resource gathering, pathfinding, wildlife encounters
**River**: Water crossing, equipment management, hypothermia risk

Each biome contains:
- **3-5 traversal challenges** (cliff faces, river crossings, cave systems)
- **2-3 resource opportunities** (fishing spots, foraging areas, water sources)
- **1-2 environmental hazards** (weather events, dangerous wildlife, unstable terrain)

### Minimum Viable Progression

The MVP tracks four essential metrics:

**Distance covered**: Raw kilometers traveled toward objectives
**Calories consumed vs. gathered**: Net energy balance
**Team cohesion**: Measured through synchronized actions and shared decisions
**Survival duration**: Days maintained above critical thresholds

These metrics drive a simple elimination structure: Bottom team each day faces removal. No voting. No politics. Pure performance.

### Audio Design Philosophy

Sound communicates physiological state more effectively than visual indicators:

**Breathing patterns** accelerate with exertion, become ragged with exhaustion
**Heartbeat** increases with effort, becomes irregular under stress
**Stomach sounds** intensify with hunger, creating visceral discomfort
**Environmental audio** shifts with fatigue—distant sounds become threatening

This audio-first approach to communicating player state maintains immersion while providing essential feedback.

### Network Architecture Requirements

The multiplayer foundation requires:

**Authoritative server**: Prevents cheating in competitive environment
**State synchronization**: 10Hz update rate for movement, 1Hz for resources
**Lag compensation**: Predictive movement with server reconciliation
**Minimal bandwidth**: Target <10KB/s per player pair

### MVP Scope Definition

Version 1.0 contains:
- **One 5km race route** through all three biomes
- **Six food source types** (fish, berries, roots, mushrooms, birds, water)
- **Three equipment items** (rope, knife, fire starter)
- **Four player backgrounds** with unique abilities
- **2-8 player support** (1-4 teams)
- **3-day race duration** (approximately 2 hours real-time)

### Development Prioritization

Build in this exact order:

1. **Movement and stamina system** (Week 1-2)
2. **Terrain interaction and resistance** (Week 3)
3. **Basic multiplayer synchronization** (Week 4-5)
4. **Hunger/calorie tracking** (Week 6)
5. **Resource gathering mechanics** (Week 7)
6. **Environmental hazards** (Week 8)
7. **Audio implementation** (Week 9)
8. **UI/UX polish** (Week 10)
9. **Balance testing** (Week 11-12)

### The Philosophical Core

This MVP succeeds not through feature completeness but through authentic representation of human limitation. Players must feel the weight of their decisions, the cost of their mistakes, the value of their partnerships.

The game asks a simple question: When everything unnecessary has been stripped away, what remains? The answer emerges through play—sometimes cooperation, sometimes betrayal, always the fundamental drive to survive another day.

By focusing on these essential elements, the MVP creates a foundation that can expand organically based on player behavior and community feedback. The core loop—move, manage resources, maintain partnerships—contains infinite variation within its constraints.

This is game design as experimental philosophy: What happens when we reduce human experience to its essential components and ask players to navigate the space between cooperation and competition, between individual survival and collective success?

The answer, like all profound truths, emerges not from the designer's intent but from the player's choices under authentic pressure.
