## üìä Success Metrics

The MVP succeeds through **authentic representation of human limitation** rather than feature completeness. Players must feel:

- ‚öñÔ∏è **Weight of decisions** through meaningful resource management
- üí• **Cost of mistakes** via permanent consequences  
- ü§ù **Value of partnerships** through mechanical interdependence
- üò∞ **Authentic pressure** from physiological simulation

This foundation creates infinite variation within its constraints, allowing organic expansion based on player behavior and community feedback while maintaining the philosophical core: reducing human experience to essential components and observing what emerges under authentic competitive pressure.
